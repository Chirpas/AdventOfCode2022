Giant crane moving crates around a loading area.
    - crates can only be accessed one at a time
    - first in, last out policy

Goal:
    - using a set of instructions, track the state of the box movements

Thoughts:
    - read input into two data structures:
        1. an object of stacks
        2. an array of instructions
    - for each instruction:
        - pop n items off src and push them onto the dest.


Part 2:
    - now the crane can move up to three boxes at once
    - not much needs to change, just modify the pop/push logic.
    - Infact, have an intermediate stack, push up to three crates into it, then pop until it's empty onto the destination.
    - Another way of doing this would be to slice the src array and push to destination
